# AEVB In PyTorch

A custom implementation of AEVB/VAE in PyTorch

See Notebook for results on MNIST so far (also have Frey Face results but not yet uploaded)

WIP, looking to extend in the following ways:
* New data
* Regularised Decoder/Prior on weights
* Different Architectures
* t-SNE plots galore
